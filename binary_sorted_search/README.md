# Sorted search

Implement function count_numbers that accepts a sorted list of unique integers and, efficiently with respect to time used, counts the number of list elements that are less than the parameter less_than.

For example, count_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7], 4) should return 2 because there are two list elements less than 4.
